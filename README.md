# age-detection-
As part of my summer internship, I was asked to make a people counter code; the inspiration for the code was https://www.pyimagesearch.com/2018/08/13/opencv-people-counter/ .
I decided after completing my internship I wanted to look more into Adrian Rosebrock's codes & blog post.I found this post to be interesting as i thought it would be funny 
to see how old i looked according to ai& machiene learning


## How To Use:
* Run: python detect_age_video.py --face face_detector --age age_detector
* Ensure: In the code it states the video file name and loaction



## Setup
     1. Make sure you have OpenVINO installed
     2. Install the required libraries (OpenCV, NumPy, SciPy, dlib, imutils) by searching online or using pip install
     3. Download this git repo as a zip
     4. Extract the file to the Documents directory

## Running The Code
     5. Change directory
          ~ cd C:\Users\<USERNAME>\Documents\PeopleCounterShared
     6. Run the code
          ~ python detect_age_video.py --face face_detector --age age_detector
